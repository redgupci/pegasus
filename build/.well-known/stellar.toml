ORG_DESCRIPTION="Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum - you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network."

desc="Originally referred to as Ethereum 2.0, the merge is an upgraded version of the Ethereum blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism to verify transactions via staking. The staking mechanism Ethereum replaces the proof-of-work model where cryptocurrency miners use high-powered computers to complete complex mathematical functions known as hashes. The mining process requires an ever-increasing amount of electricity to verify Ethereum transactions before they are recorded on the public blockchain."
